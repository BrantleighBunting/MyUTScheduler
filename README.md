// Markdown Editor

### Development Environment

Here is how to set up our development environment:
* Install Git
* Install Sublime Text (or editor of your choice)
* Install Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/ - v9.0.0
* Install Yarn - https://yarnpkg.com/en/ - v1.3.2
### Once The Dependencies Are Installed
```
git clone https://github.com/edrodriguez/MyUTScheduler
cd MyUTScheduler
yarn install
yarn dev
```
Then in browser at http://localhost:8080 the scheduler will be served, changed in code
will be hot reloaded in browser for fast development.

THIS IS ALL YOU NEED FOR NOW. The following is for actual development. We'll talk more about it later

### Git Workflow

```
git pull https://github.com/edrodriguez/MyUTScheduler
cd MyUTScheduler
// do some meaningful work
// when ready to commit run
git status
// if everything looks ok then
git commit -m "Some good message"
// then push changes back to master
git push
```

# TODO List:

// insert all the things here
